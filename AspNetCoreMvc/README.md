=======
To run this sample, edit [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) and **set your DSN** to see the events in Sentry.

Running the Demo
1. Configure your DSN in [appsettings.json](appsettings.json)
2. Configure your org slug and project slug in [deploy.ps1](deploy.ps1)
3. Run `./deploy.ps1` from PowerShell `pwsh`

Check [Program.cs](Program.cs) to see some Sentry customization done via the `WebHostBuilder`.

### In this sample we demonstrate the following:

* Initialize the SDK via the ASP.NET Integration (Program.cs UseSentry())
* Configure the SDK via the framework configuration system (appsettings.json, env var, etc)
* Using a custom `ExceptionProcessor`. (See `SpecialExceptionProcessor.cs` which takes dependencies vai DI)
* Adding custom data to be reported with the exception (See `HomeController.cs` `PostIndex` action, the catch block adding to `Data` property of the exception)
* Capturing an exception manually via an injected `IHub`. (See `HomeController.cs` `Contact` action.)
* Captures an unhandled exception coming from a view (See `About.cshtml` which throws an exception that goes through the `SpecialExceptionProcessor.cs`)
* Including the request payload with the event (done via appsettings.json `IncludeRequestPayload`)
* Sentry commits/releases integration using `sentry-cli` (done in deploy.ps1)
